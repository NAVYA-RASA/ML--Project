# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Batch Normalization, Dropout, Data Augmentation, and dynamic early stopping to improve model generalization.

## 🚀 Features
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Data Augmentation with `ImageDataGenerator`
- Batch Normalization & Dropout for better regularization
- Dynamic early stopping based on validation accuracy
- Achieved up to 85.58% validation accuracy

## 📊 Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- Available directly from Keras: `tf.keras.datasets.cifar10`
